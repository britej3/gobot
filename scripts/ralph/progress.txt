## Codebase Patterns
- Use types.PositionState from pkg/types to avoid circular dependencies between internal/agent and pkg/platform
- Binance futures OrderType only has LIMIT, MARKET, LIQUIDATION constants - use string literals for STOP and TAKE_PROFIT
- NewMarkPriceService is deprecated - use NewPremiumIndexService instead
- Always check for import cycles when packages reference each other
